  <h1>Steven Wong's Planning Site for CTD3C</h1>
    <p>I am making a planning site for a webpage that I will make.</p>

  <h2>Brainstorm</h2>
  <p><strong>Possible Website Ideas</strong></p>
  <ul>

    <li>Website for Jordan Leadership Club</li>
    <li>Website for Winter Fair</li>
    <li>Website that lists and describes all the clubs offered in AIS</li>

  </ul>
  <h2>Chosen Project - <strong>AIS Clubs</strong></h2>
  <p>We will make a website that lists and describes all the clubs offered in AIS<br>
    <br>Audience: AIS Students
    <br>Client: Ms. Kruse
    <br>Purpose: For students in AIS to find <em>AND</em> join clubs that they are interested in.
  </p>

  <h3>Objectives</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>For AIS students to learn about the clubs in the school</li>
    <li>For AIS students to have contact information for the club they are interested in</li>
    <li>For AIS students to easily find what they need on the website</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Website can be accessed by students</li>
    <li>Website shows the clubs available for AIS students</li>
    <li>Has videos and photos for each club</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Flowcharts</h3>
  <p>I have created 3 flowcharts to help plan my website.</p>
  <p><a href="Flowchart1.png">Flowchart 1</a></p>
  <p><a href="Flowchart2.png">Flowchart 2</a></p>
  <p><a href="Flowchart3.png">Flowchart 3</a></p>
  <p>We chose the first flowchart because this one is the most organized flowchart, which allows the <br>
    students to easily find what they need. By putting the clubs into categories, the audience can<br>
    select which category they are interested in to find a club for them.<br>
