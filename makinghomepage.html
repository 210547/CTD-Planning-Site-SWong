<head><title>Making a Home Page</title></head>
<body>
  <p>This site will explain how I made my Home Page</p>

  <h3>Wireframe Ideas</h3>
    <p>A Wireframe is the skeletal framework of a website. These are the two Wireframes I have created.</p>
    <p><a href="Wireframe1.png">Wireframe 1<a></p>
    <p><a href="Wireframe2.png">Wireframe 2<a></p>
    <p>I chose the 2nd Wireframe because there are less things that the user can click on, so the home page will be easier to use. Also it does not show all the clubs on the home page<br>
      so it is less cluttered and feels more organized for the user.
    <br><img src="Wireframe2.png" width="35%" height="35%"></p>

  <h3>Storyboard</h3>
    <p>A Storyboard is the Wireframe with color, pictures, and text. It can show how you want the website to look like. This is the storyboard I have created.</p>
    <img src="Storyboard.png" width="30%" height="40%">
    <h4>Feedback</h4>
      <p>The video might take up too much of the space, so I make the space for the video smaller.</p>

  <h3>The homepages I have made</h3>
    <p>In class I learned how to make the home page for my website using Fireworks and Dreamweaver.
      <br><a href="https://creative.adobe.com/products/fireworks">Fireworks</a> is a tool for creating images.
      <br><a href="http://www.adobe.com/hk_en/products/dreamweaver.html">Dreamweaver</a> is a tool for developing a webpage.
      <br>For fireworks, you need to use the slice tool and slice the storyboard into many pieces according to your wireframe. For dreamweaver, you need<br>
       to create AP divs for the parts you sliced in fireworks. Then you add the text, color, and images using html.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="htdocs/index-FW.htm">Fireworks Version</a></li>
      <li><a href="htdocs/index-DW.html">Dreamweaver Version</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both homepages follow the original flowchart and achieves the objectives.<br>The homepages allows the students to find clubs they will be interested in because they are seperated in categories.</p>
    <h4>Learning</h4>
      <p>While creating the Dreamweaver homepage, I learned how to use z-index for css. I was having trouble ordering the AP divs, but by using z-index I could set the order of them.
      <br><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_z-index.asp">Website that I used to learn about z-index.</a></p>

    <h4>Comparison and Evaluation</h4>
      <p>
        After using both Fireworks and Dreamweaver to create a home page, I have noticed many differences between them.<br>
        Fireworks is more user friendly because you just need to create the images instead of typing html/css. You don't need to<br>
        know html/css to make your homepage on fireworks. Also it takes less time to create your home page on Fireworks than Dreamweaver.<br>
        However using Dreamweaver allows you to have more customization and it is easier to change something.  Also since the Fireworks<br>
        version is all images you can't search them on google but you can for Dreamweaver.<br>

        <br>For example say that I want to change the logo for my website. If I use Fireworks I need to delete the slice and the original logo, and <br>
        then put in the new logo and slice it <u>again</u>. THEN I need to export it into html <u>again</u>. But for Dreamweaver it is <strong>easier</strong> <br>
        because you just need change the link to your new logo.

        <ul><strong>Fireworks</strong>
          <li>More user friendly</li>
          <li>Don't need to understand html/css</li>
          <li>Quicker to create a <u>completed</u> homepage</li>
          <li>Less customization</li>
          <li>Harder to change something</li>
          <li>Can't search the text on google</li>
        </ul>

        <ul><strong>Dreamweaver</strong>
          <li>Not as user friendly</li>
          <li>Need to understand how to use html/css</li>
          <li>Takes longer to create a <u>competed</u> homepage</li>
          <li>More customization</li>
          <li>Easier to change something</li>
          <li>Can search the text on google</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

  <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>The flowchart and homepage is user-focused because the user can choose the category that they are interested in <br>
      to find clubs they would join. The audience (AIS Students) is specific enough because they are the students who would use the website.</p>
