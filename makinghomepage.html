  <h3>Wireframe Ideas</h3>
    <p><a href="Wireframe1.png">Wireframe 1<a></p>
    <p><a href="Wireframe2.png">Wireframe 2<a></p>
    <br><p>We chose the second Wireframe.

    <h4>Feedback</h4>
      <p>The video might take up too much of the space, so I make the space for the video smaller.

  <h3>The homepages I have made</h3>
    <p>In class I learned how to make the home page for my website using Fireworks and Dreamweaver. For fireworks, you need<br>
      to use the slice tool and slice the storyboard into many pieces according to your wireframe. For dreamweaver, you need<br>
       to create AP divs for the parts you sliced in fireworks. Then you add the text, color, and images using html.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="htdocs/index-FW.htm">Fireworks Version</a></li>
      <li><a href="htdocs/index-DW.html">Dreamweaver Version</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both homepages follow the original flowchart and achieves the objectives.<br>The homepage allows the students to find clubs they will be interested in because they are seperated in categories.</p>
    <h4>Comparison and Evaluation</h4>
      <p>
        After using both Fireworks and Dreamweaver to create a home page, I have noticed many differences between them.<br>
        It is easier to use Fireworks to make your home page because you just need to create the images instead of typing<br>
        the code. Also it takes less time to create your home page on Fireworks than Dreamweaver. However using Dreamweaver<br>
        allows you to have more customization and it is easier to change something. If you want to change the background <br>
        color all you need to do is change the code for the color. Also since the Fireworks version is all images you <br>
        can't search them on google but you can for Dreamweaver.

        <ul><strong>Fireworks</strong>
          <li>Easier to use</li>
          <li>Quicker to create a homepage</li>
          <li>Less customization</li>
          <li>Harder to change something</li>
          <li>Can't search the text on google</li>
        </ul>

        <ul><strong>Dreamweaver</strong>
          <li>Harder to use</li>
          <li>Takes longer to create a homepage</li>
          <li>More customization</li>
          <li>Easier to change something</li>
          <li>Can search the text on google</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

  <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>The flowchart and homepage is user-focused because the user can choose the category that they are interested in <br>
      to find clubs they would join. The audience (AIS Students) is specific enough because the people who would use this website are AIS students. </p>
