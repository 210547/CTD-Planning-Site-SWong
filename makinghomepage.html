  <h3>Wireframe Ideas</h3>
    <p><a href="Wireframe1.png">Wireframe 1<a></p>
    <p><a href="Wireframe2.png">Wireframe 2<a></p>
    <p>I chose the 2nd Wireframe because there are less things that the user can click on, so the home page will be easier to use. Also it does not show all the clubs on the home page<br>
      so it is less cluttered and feels more organized for the user.
    <br><img src="Wireframe2.png" width="35%" height="35%"></p>

  <h3>Storyboard</h3>

    <h4>Feedback</h4>
      <p>The video might take up too much of the space, so I make the space for the video smaller.</p>

  <h3>The homepages I have made</h3>
    <p>In class I learned how to make the home page for my website using Fireworks and Dreamweaver. For fireworks, you need<br>
      to use the slice tool and slice the storyboard into many pieces according to your wireframe. For dreamweaver, you need<br>
       to create AP divs for the parts you sliced in fireworks. Then you add the text, color, and images using html.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="htdocs/index-FW.htm">Fireworks Version</a></li>
      <li><a href="htdocs/index-DW.html">Dreamweaver Version</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>While creating the Dreamweaver homepage, I learned how to use z-index for css. I was having trouble ordering the AP divs, but by using z-index I could set the order of them.
    <br><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_z-index.asp">Website that I used.</a></p>
    <p>Both homepages follow the original flowchart and achieves the objectives.<br>The homepages allows the students to find clubs they will be interested in because they are seperated in categories.</p>
    <h4>Comparison and Evaluation</h4>
      <p>
        After using both Fireworks and Dreamweaver to create a home page, I have noticed many differences between them.<br>
        Fireworks is more user friendly because you just need to create the images instead of typing html/css. You don't need to<br>
        know html/css to make your homepage on fireworks. Also it takes less time to create your home page on Fireworks than Dreamweaver.<br>
        However using Dreamweaver allows you to have more customization and it is easier to change something. If you want to change the background <br>
        color all you need to do is change the hex code for the color. Also since the Fireworks version is all images you <br>
        can't search them on google but you can for Dreamweaver.

        <ul><strong>Fireworks</strong>
          <li>More user friendly</li>
          <li>Don't need to know html/css</li>
          <li>Quicker to create a homepage</li>
          <li>Less customization</li>
          <li>Harder to change something</li>
          <li>Can't search the text on google</li>
        </ul>

        <ul><strong>Dreamweaver</strong>
          <li>Not as user friendly</li>
          <li>Need to know how to use html/css</li>
          <li>Takes longer to create a homepage</li>
          <li>More customization</li>
          <li>Easier to change something</li>
          <li>Can search the text on google</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

  <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>The flowchart and homepage is user-focused because the user can choose the category that they are interested in <br>
      to find clubs they would join. The audience (AIS Students) is specific enough because they are the students who would use the website.</p>
