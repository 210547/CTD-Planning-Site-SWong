    <p>This site will explain how I made my subpages.</p>
    <h1>Review</h1>
    <p><strong>Purpose: </strong>To have a website that allows students to find and join clubs that they are interested in.
      <br><br><strong>Audience:</strong> AIS Students
      <br><br><strong>Main Message:</strong>
      <br>The purpose, audience, and main message has not changed. They are still relevent to our website.
    </p>
    <h1>Flowchart Review</h1>
      <img src="Flowchart1.png">
      <p>We are still using the flowchart chosen before. However now we do not need a website that has a list of all the clubs because we are adding navigation bar that will list the clubs.

    <h1>Website Look and Feel</h1>
      <p>Our theme for our website is to have the background in <span style="color: #91A8B7">light gray</span>, the text white, and any other boxes <span style="color: #50728A">greyish blue</span>
