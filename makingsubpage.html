    <p>This site will explain how I made my subpages.</p>
    <h1>Review</h1>
    <p><strong>Purpose: </strong>To have a website that allows students to find and join clubs that they are interested in.
      <br><br><strong>Audience:</strong> AIS Students
      <br><br><strong>Main Message:</strong> To show the clubs available for AIS students so that more people can join them.
      <br><br>The purpose, audience, and main message has not changed. They are still relevent to our website.
    </p>
    <h1>Flowchart Review</h1>
      <img src="Flowchart1.png">
      <p>We are still using the flowchart chosen before. However now we do not need a website that has a list of all the clubs because we are adding a navigation bar that will list the clubs.

    <h1>Website Look and Feel</h1>
    <p> The message that our website is giving out is to help you find clubs that you are interested in</p>
      <p>Our theme for our website is to have the background in <span style="color: #91A8B7">light gray</span>, the text white, and any other boxes <span style="color: #50728A">greyish blue</span>
      <p><a href="../CTD-Extra-Curricular-Activities-/jlc.html">Example of Website Look and Feel</a></p>
      <p>Essential parts of the website: The title of the website on the top, the AIS logo under the title, and the navigation bar.

    <p>Every page will have the page banner, all in the same place and same size. All the font
    <br>  will be in "Comic Sans MS" All of the text will be in white. The navigation bar will be
    <br> under the page banner and will be on every page. The navigation bar shows the categories
    <br>  of the clubs.

    <h1>Feedback</h1>
      <h4>My Feedback</h4>
    <p>The homepage is very empty, not complete yet. Also currently, the webpage does not link
      <br>  to the other pages so it is not usable. However, the font is clear and the font size is
      <br>  big enough to be read easily. The website is easy to navigate.
    </p>
    <h4>Classmate's Feedback</h4>
    <p> Good font, good color choice, Maybe add more vibrant colors, more eye appealing.
    Improvements: Fix the blank spot, dont make the words at the edge. Easy to use.</p>

    <h1>Template Wireframe</h1>
    <a href="Templatewireframe.png">Template Wireframe</a>

    <h1>Template</h1>
    <a href="Template.html">Template</a>
    <p>This is the template that I have created in dreamweaver. It is based on the template wireframe.
      <br> I made ediable regions so that only some parts could be changed.</p>
