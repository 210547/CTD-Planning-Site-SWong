    <p>This site will explain how I made my subpages.</p>
    <h1>Review: MAP</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>(M)ain Message:</strong> That AIS students should participate in clubs available in AIS.
      <br><strong>(A)udience:</strong> AIS Students
      <br><strong>(P)urpose: </strong>To have a website that allows students to find and join clubs that they are interested in.


      <br><br>The purpose, audience, and main message has not changed. They are still relevent to our website.
    </p>
    <h1>Flowchart Review</h1>
      <img src="Flowchart1.png">
      <p>We are still using the flowchart chosen before. However now we do not need a website that has a list of all the clubs
        <br> because we are adding a navigation bar that will list the clubs when hovered on.

    <h1>Website Look and Feel</h1>
    <p> The message that our website is giving out is to help you find clubs that you are interested in</p>
      <p>Our theme for our website is to have the background in <span style="color: #91A8B7">light gray</span>,
        <br>the text white, and any other boxes <span style="color: #50728A">greyish blue</span></p>
      <p>We wanted our website to have this specific look and feel because we used cool colors to make the website
        <br>look clean and still have color. If we used sharp colors such as bright red it would distract the
        <br>audience.</p>

      <p><a href="jlc.html">Example of Website Look and Feel</a></p>
      <p>Essential parts of the website to be on every page: The title of the website on the top, the AIS logo under the title, and the navigation bar.

    <p>Every page will have the page banner, all in the same place and same size. All the font
    <br>  will be in "Comic Sans MS" All of the text will be in white. The navigation bar will be
    <br> under the page banner and will be on every page. The navigation bar shows the categories
    <br>  of the clubs.

    <h1>Feedback</h1>
      <h4>My Feedback</h4>
    <p>The homepage is very empty, not complete yet. Also currently, the webpage does not link
      <br>  to the other pages so it is not usable. However, the font is clear and the font size is
      <br>  big enough to be read easily. The website is easy to navigate.
    </p>
    <h4>Classmate's Feedback</h4>
    <p> Easy to use, good font, good color choice, add more vibrant colors to make it more eye appealing.
  <br>  Improvements: Fix the blank spot on the right, dont make the words at the edge.</p>

    <h1>Template Wireframe</h1>
    <a href="Templatewireframe.png">Template Wireframe</a>
    <p>Parts in red will not change.</p>
    <p>Parts in green will change on each subpage.</p>

    <h1>Template</h1>
    <a href="Template.html">Template</a>
    <p>This is the template that I have created in dreamweaver. It is based on the template wireframe.
      <br>When you hover over a category in the navigation bar, it will list out the clubs in that category.
      <br> I made ediable regions so that when you make a new page using that template, only specific parts could be changed.</p>
    <p><a href="Editable Regions.png">Editable Regions Labeled in Green</a></p>
    <p>Using this template, you can easily make sub pages for this website because the layout has already
    <br>been created.</p>
